[00:00.00]Ally Kerr <The Sore Feet Song>[00:14.73]I walked ten thousand miles, ten thousand miles to see you. [00:21.37]And ever gasp to breath, I grabbed it just to find you. [00:27.91]I climbed up every hill to get to you. [00:34.96]I wandered ancient lands to hold just you. [00:41.65]And every single step of the way, I paid. [00:48.73]Every single night and day I searched for you. [01:01.71]Through sand storms and hazy dawns I reached for you. [01:17.46]I stole ten thousand pounds, ten thousand pounds to see you. [01:23.56]I robbed convenience stores coz I thought they'd make it easier. [01:29.90]I lived off rats and toads and I starved for you. [01:36.29]I fought off giant bears and I killed them too. [01:43.42]And every single step of the way, I paid. [01:50.06]Every single night and day I searched for you. [02:02.85]Through sand storms and hazy dawns I searched for you. [02:11.38]I'm tired and I'm weak but I'm strong for you. [02:19.89]I want to go home but my love gets me through.[02:28.16]la la la la la la la la la la la [02:36.52]la la la la la la la la la la la
